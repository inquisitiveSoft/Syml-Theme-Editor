# Why another Markdown Parser?
I wanted a parser which could parse a documents semantics as well as apply styling, and was efficient enough to be updated as the user types. It's simple, efficient, thread safe and compatible with both iOS and Mac.

Get in touch via Twitter [@inquisitivesoft](https://twitter.com/inquisitiveSoft) if you have any comments or queries. I'm open to issues or pull requests and would love to hear if you end up using SYMLMarkdownParser in one of your projects.

# Where to Start
- The core processing is all done in SYMLMarkdownParser.h's `SYMLParseMarkdown()` function
- SYMLMarkdownTextFormatter's `-parseString:â€¦` method is a good place to look for example usage

# What it doesn't do
- It doesn't convert markdown to HTML. There are many more feature complete parsers for that: [MultiMarkdown-4](https://github.com/fletcher/MultiMarkdown-4) is my current favourite.
- Currently doesn't highlight `code`, ![image]() tags or inline em*phas*is elements
- Needs tests

# Requirements
- Requires [RegexKitLite](http://regexkit.sourceforge.net/) which links against the system *libicucore.dylib* library
- Tested on iOS 7 and OS X 10.9, but should be compatible back to iOS 4.0 and OS X 10.6
